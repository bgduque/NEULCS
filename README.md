# NEUVIS - Virtual ID System  

NEUVIS is a visitor management system for school security, built using **React Native, TypeScript, Expo, and Supabase**.  

## üìå Tech Stack  
- **React Native** - Mobile app framework  
- **Expo** - Development environment  
- **Supabase** - Backend services  
- **TypeScript** - Strongly typed JavaScript  

## üöÄ Getting Started  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/NEUVIS.git
cd NEUVIS
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies  
```sh
npm install
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Expo Go on Your Mobile Device  
**Why do we need Expo Go?**  
Expo Go allows us to run and test our React Native app directly on a physical device without the need for a complicated build process. It enables **live reloading**, meaning any changes made in the code will reflect in real-time on the app without restarting the development server.  

üì≤ **To install Expo Go:**  
- **For Android:** [Download from Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)  
- **For iOS:** [Download from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)  

Once installed, you'll be able to scan the QR code provided by `npx expo start` to run the app on your phone.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Environment Variables  
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:  
```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Development Server  
```sh
npx expo start
```
- If using a **physical device**, open **Expo Go** and scan the QR code displayed in your terminal or browser.  
- If using an **emulator**, make sure it's running before starting the project.

This should ensure that your team understands why Expo Go is needed and how to set it up. Let me know if you need any other clarifications! üöÄ
